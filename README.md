# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this website as part of my first steps into the coding world. This website was part of my Prework course work for my coding bootcamp, and it solves the problem of needing a study guide to refer back to if I get stuck during bootcamp. I learned a lot of troubleshooting skills, how to thoroughly analyze my code to fix my mistakes, and I learned how to use Github, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I still have a lot to learn but this is the first of many projects as a coder.

## Usage

This Study Guide can be used to refer to some key tips that I found useful to me that I thought would be worthy to remember during bootcamp. I also included a link to the Git Command Cheat sheet because there are a lot of commands and this is a handy way to remember them. Each section of the site contains notes about topics such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Upon opening the DevTools console, we can see that JavaScript is running and we are recommended a topic to study first.
